# ReinstallGuard for macos
OnGuard often malfunctions, making it impossible to access the school network. 

To resolve this issue, it is necessary to reinstall OnGuard. 

In fact, once OnGuard turns green, the authentication is successful and it does not need to be run for a long time. 

Therefore, this script automatically installs and uninstalls OnGuard for a one-time OnGuard authentication. 
(Note: after installing OnGuard, wait for it to turn green before confirming the uninstallation.)

Simply run this script whenever you cannot access the network.
